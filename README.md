Ext JS 4 and Ext JS 5 version of Condor's Ext.ux.data.PagingStore (see Ext JS forum thread here http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?71532-Ext.ux.data.PagingStore-v0.5)

Test files are for Siesta, http://www.bryntum.com/products/siesta/

There are enough changes between 4.1, 4.2 and 5.x that there are now three branches for this project.  They are pretty self explanatory:

* master - works with 4.1
* extjs-4.2-branch
* extjs-5.0.branch


All three branches pass the unit tests.  The project is now "self-contained" and you should be able to pull down the project and run the tests yourself.
